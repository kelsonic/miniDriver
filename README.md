# miniDriver
This is a Dev Bootcamp final project to program a self-driving rc car.

## Steps
### Day 1
As none of us had (much) experience with Python, we decided to concentrate on learning Python for the first half of the day. We flew through [this Udemy python bootcamp course](https://www.udemy.com/complete-python-bootcamp/) and together developed a solid understanding of Python fundamentals and data structures.

In the second half of the day, we concentrated on discovering and installing machine learning libraries (mostly OpenCV). We also delved into neural networks and found [this incredible repo](https://github.com/FlorianMuellerklein/Machine-Learning) that contains machine-learning algorithms for [perceptrons](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap1.html).

In the evening (and night), we built a track for the rc car and aggregated resources for Day 2 to learn more about using Raspberry Pi with both RC cars and machine-learning libraries.

### Day 2
The morning consisted of studying more about machine-learning and neural networks. We also (finally) successfully installed OpenCV, mostly thanks to [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U49CVY8yOxw).

We then aggregated both positive and negative images for stop-lights and stop-signs. Using OpenCV, we then generated classifiers for both and tested it using our computers' webcams, which worked (though our algorithms definitely need more refining with extra positive and negative images).

Later in the evening, we had a visit from a data scientist who explained to us the power of both (numpy)[http://www.numpy.org/] and (matplotlib)[http://matplotlib.org/] python libraries. We were then able
